        <p class="info__text">
            The hot air balloon is the first successful human-carrying flight technology. The first untethered manned
            hot air balloon flight was performed by Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier and François Laurent d'Arlandes on
            November 21, 1783, in Paris, France, in a balloon created by the Montgolfier brothers. 
            </p>
            <p class="info__text">The first hot-air
            balloon flown in the Americas was launched from the Walnut Street Jail in Philadelphia on January 9, 1793 by
            the French aeronaut Jean Pierre Blanchard. Hot air balloons that can be propelled through the air rather
            than simply drifting with the wind are known as thermal airships.

                A hot air balloon is a lighter-than-air aircraft consisting of a bag, called an envelope, which contains
                heated air. Suspended beneath is a gondola or wicker basket (in some long-distance or high-altitude
                balloons, a capsule), which carries passengers and a source of heat, in most cases an open flame caused
                by
                burning liquid propane. The heated air inside the envelope makes it buoyant since it has a lower density
                than the colder air outside the envelope.

                The French brothers Joseph-Michel and Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier developed a hot air balloon in
                Annonay, Ardeche, France and demonstrated it publicly on September 19, 1783, making an unmanned flight
                lasting 10 minutes. After experimenting with unmanned balloons and flights with animals, the first
                balloon flight with humans aboard, a tethered flight, performed on or around October 15, 1783, by
                Jean-Francois Pilatre de Rozier who made at least one tethered flight from the yard of the Reveillon
                workshop in the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. Later that same day, Pilatre de Rozier became the second human
                to ascend into the air, reaching an altitude of 26 m (85 ft), the length of the tether. The first
                free flight with human passengers was made a few weeks later, on November 21, 1783.

                Modern hot air balloons, with an onboard heat source, were developed by Ed Yost, beginning during the
                1950s; his work resulted in his first successful flight, on October 22, 1960. The first modern hot
                air balloon to be made in the United Kingdom (UK) was the Bristol Belle, built in 1967. Presently, hot
                air balloons are used primarily for recreation.

                A hot air balloon for manned flight uses a single-layered, fabric gas bag (lifting "envelope"), with an
                opening at the bottom called the mouth or throat. Attached to the envelope is a basket, or gondola, for
                carrying the passengers. Mounted above the basket and centered in the mouth is the "burner", which
                injects a flame into the envelope, heating the air within. The heater or burner is fueled by propane, a
                liquefied gas stored in pressure vessels, similar to high pressure forklift cylinders.
